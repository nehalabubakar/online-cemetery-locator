(14, NULL, 'Byron Gorman', '04/21/1988 - 11/18/2020', 'On April 21, 1988, our Heavenly Father placed an angel on earth to bless us with his loving heart, overwhelming generosity, captivating charm, contagious smile, and brilliance. This “Earthly Angel” was Byron Vincent Gorman.  He was born the youngest of three children in Cleveland, Ohio to the union of Vincent and Robin Gorman.  Byron, often very quiet in nature, was a “loud giant” when it came to his earthly angelic tasks, because his goal was to always help others in whatever way possible and to make people smile and laugh on life’s journey.  On November 18, 2020, our Heavenly Father told Byron that his angelic task of providing blessings to others on earth was complete and it was time for him to come to his heavenly home.\r\n\r\nByron accepted his task as an “Earthly Angel” when he accepted Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior at an early age at New Community Bible Fellowship located in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.  The job of an Angel is to bring peace to difficult situations and help people to remain calm and relaxed.  Byron never wanted anyone to stress over any situation and would make sure that he would provide comedic relief to ease all tension.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Byron displayed his angelic charm through modeling.  His success in modeling landed him a contract with a major modeling agency in New York and he won the American International Competition for his age division.  Byron was one who believed in the fact that, “the more one learns, the better off one will be.”  Byron was a graduate of the 2006 Class of Shaker Heights High School in Shaker Heights, Ohio.  While at Shaker Heights High School, Byron excelled as the star wide receiver for the Red Raiders and was the top pick for the East West Conference Championship game in 2006. He was awarded a scholarship to play at Kentucky State University located in Frankfort, Kentucky.  While at Kentucky State, Byron played wide receiver for the “Thorobreds”.  He later enrolled at The University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio.  He received an Associate’s Degree in Business from Tri-C Community College in Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nAfter college, he began his career working with his parents, Vincent and Robin, to manage their State Farm Agency located in Shaker Heights, Ohio.  He also pursued a career in real estate and worked with Century 21 as a Real Estate Agent.  Byron was very progressive, goal-oriented, and had an intrinsic entrepreneurial spirit.  He flourished in his entrepreneurial endeavors.  He never failed to exemplify his angelic spirit at work and there are numerous individuals whom he impacted with his presence.\r\n\r\nByron was a world traveler.  His journey took him to various locations in Europe such as the following: Paris, France; London, England; Barcelona, Spain; and several locations in Italy.  Byron was also an avid reader.  His favorite book was the Holy Bible and he loved books on leadership development and novels.  This was a great source of comfort to him.\r\n\r\nByron always displayed his angelic spirit by showing his commitment to others through public service.  He was a strong supporter of his community.  Byron’s favorite past times were spent on a golf course, shopping for the latest fashions, watching his favorite football team, and taking care of his dog, Blaze.  Sunday afternoons were overtaken with phone calls to his siblings and parents talking about the football games.\r\n\r\nByron was convinced that his most important task as an “Earthly Angel” was to make sure that everyone knows that the greatest asset in life is family.  Spending time with his family was a significant key to his success and happiness.  He never hesitated to make sure that his parents always had whatever they needed.  He worked diligently and tirelessly to help them succeed in their business and enjoyed traveling across the country with them.  They were his best friends.  As a brother, he was the typical “little brother” always making his siblings laugh and always being their biggest cheerleader.  He was the epitome of an uncle.  His nephews never lacked in love, communication, guidance, and a friend in “Uncle Man Man”.  Byron forever cherished the memories of those family members who preceded him in death: his maternal grandmother, Mary Robinson, affectionately known as “Grandmommy”; his paternal grandmother, Vera Gorman, affectionately known as “Grandma”; and his beloved great-grandmother, Maydean Lilly, who was affectionately known as “Goggie”.\r\n\r\nByron’s “Earthly Angelic” journey will forever be cherished and celebrated by the following: parents, Vincent and Robin Gorman of Solon, Ohio; brother, Brad Gorman of Bedford Heights, Ohio; sister, Loren (Billy) Walker of Nashville (Brentwood), Tennessee; maternal grandfather, Glenn Robinson of Cleveland, Ohio; nephew, Billy (Trace) Walker, III of Nashville (Brentwood), Tennessee; nephew, Qaiden Gorman of Bedford Heights, Ohio; nephew, Braxton Walker of Nashville (Brentwood), Tennessee; Uncles; Aunts; and a host of cousins.\r\n\r\nByron Vincent Gorman was truly an “Angel on Earth”!', 'Byron_Gorman.jpg'),
