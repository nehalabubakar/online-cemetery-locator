					and I love to honor our loved ones that have passed, by visiting their plots. My husband has a big
					heart and loved to plan trips to sit next to his family for visits and he would share his stories
					about their lives together. Perhaps we planned to clean the plot or just have nice visit, but there
					were times we just couldn't find them. Not only that, but there were times that the tombstones/
					plaques would also be buried under mud, flooded due to weather conditions. On our visits I have
					watched people wander around in search of their loved ones' headstone/plot. I am sure you've, or
					someone you know, has planned a visit and sometimes search in vain because they could not remember
					where they were buried, or the scenery of the cemetery changed since the last visit. Our goal is to
					remedy that issue, so you never lose track of your family plots.</p>

				<p class="ct-u-fontSize24 ct-u-colorWhite ct-u-lineHeight36 ct-u-paddingTop40 text-justify">This idea
					grew because I began to wonder, Where Are My Loved Ones Buried? I asked some family members if they
					knew where such and such had been buried, to no avail, they didn't know either. At that point, I
					Became Intrigued to locate my loved ones and share my discoveries with my family. Now our mission is
					to help others, so that no one ever feels like they cannot visit their Heavenly Loves who've
					died.</p>

				<p class="ct-u-fontSize24 ct-u-colorWhite ct-u-lineHeight36 ct-u-paddingTop40 text-justify">With the
					Pandemic and the Turn of the Economy...this website was created to make sure you have an option. We
					have a Love and Respect for our Heavenly Loves. We're here to make it simple, TO FIND YOUR LOVED
					ONES!</p>
